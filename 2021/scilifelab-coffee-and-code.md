## GPT-3 -- the most powerful AI in the world

* Made by OpenAI, released in June 2020
* 175 billion parameters
* Trained on 45TB of text data
* Costs $12 million to train once
* Not open-source (yet), only API access

-----
## Codex
 * OpenAI Codex is a descendant of GPT-3
 * GPT-3 trained on billions of lines of source code
 * Longer context (upto 4096 tokens)

-----
# üî•Codex live demos!
## disclaimer: All the demo applications have not yet been approved for launch
-----
## 1. Codex basic demos
 * Explain code
 * Write a Python docstring
 * Python bug fixer

---
## 2. Javascript UI generation demo
```
Make a snowstorm on a black background
Make a red ball bounce around the screen
Make a website for a cat that's an attorney. Provide a bio and a phone number. Create a small round avatar image: https://bit.ly/3fsc0rH. Center everything.
```
---
### 3. HPA image manipulation
```
Display this cell images on the screen: https://images.proteinatlas.org/115/672_E2_1_blue_red_green.jpg and set the width to 100px.
Add a button and when I click it make the image rotate with a random angle.
Add another button to only show the blue cells in the image.
Add a third button to make the cells a little bit blurred.
Add a fourth button for restore the image to its original state.
```
---
### 4. Display CSV table
```
display a drag and drop file field and make it visible
when the file changes, load the file content, parse the file content as a csv table, store the rows as an array of objects, then display the table on the screen!
add a button when the user click it, highlight the rows in the table contains "membrane"
Parse the x and y column in the table and save them as separate variables
add another button for parsing the x and y column in the table and save them as separate variables, then make a scatter plot with x and y (DO NOT use d3 !!!)
```

### 5. Copilot in vscode

### 6. Using API document

```markdown
# Get api docs from https://www.uniprot.org/help/api_retrieve_entries
# make a function for fetching a sequence (in fasta format) from a uniprot entry
# import the requests library
```

```markdown
# test the fetch sequence function
```

## Tips on using Codex
 * Think it as an **autocompletion** tool
 * Show and tell: Provide context and examples
 * Use API document
 * Make it clear what you want either through instructions, examples, or a combination of the two.
 * Hidden context + user input => magical application

-----
## Why Codex is important?
 * Better generalization and interpretability
 * Zero/Few-shot learning for low data domain
 * Human + AI
 * Applications in life science

-----
## Discussion
 * Drawbacks and criticisms
 * GPT-4?
 * Ethical issues
 * What do you think?
